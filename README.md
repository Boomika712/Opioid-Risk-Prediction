# Opioid Risk Sentinel: AI-Driven Predictive Analytics for Drug-Seeking Behavior Detection

Drug addiction interferes with positive health outcomes for patients being treated for other conditions. Additionally, caregivers providing drug-addiction treatment must divert much-needed resources from other patients.
Treating addiction is very expensive. U.S. healthcare organizations spend more than $500 billion annually caring for patients suffering from opioid addiction alone. Across a large healthcare organization it’s challenging to consistently identify patients at risk of becoming addicted and alert physicians to that risk

## Approach

The AI-driven solution analyzes physicians' notes and electronic medical records (EMRs) to identify drug-seeking behavior. Using advanced Deep learning, it generates alerts for doctors during patient visits, enabling early intervention. By identifying 85,000 at-risk patients and targeting $60 million in savings, the solution improves health outcomes and reduces costs, helping prevent opioid addiction and its impact.

-Analyze physicians' notes (text analytics).
-Combine with electronic medical records (EMRs).
-Use Deep learning to detect patterns of risky behavior.
