      "Recommendations: Based on the patient's condition and high risk assessment, here are some brief medical advice to reduce opioid dependency risk:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gradual Taper**: Collaborate with the patient to develop a gradual taper plan to reduce their opioid dose over time. This can help minimize withdrawal symptoms and dependence.\n",
      "2. **Alternative Pain Management**: Explore non-pharmacological and pharmacological alternatives for pain management, such as:\n",
      "\t* Physical therapy and exercise\n",
      "\t* Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\n",
      "\t* Acupuncture\n",
      "\t* Massage therapy\n",
      "\t* Gabapentin or pregabalin (if not contraindicated)\n",
      "3. **Non-Opioid Analgesics**: Consider prescribing non-opioid analgesics, such as:\n",
      "\t* NSAIDs (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) for mild to moderate pain\n",
      "\t* Tramadol or tapentadol for moderate to severe pain (if necessary)\n",
      "4. **Behavioral Interventions**: Encourage the patient to adopt healthy habits, such as:\n",
      "\t* Regular exercise and physical activity\n",
      "\t* Stress management techniques (e.g., meditation, yoga)\n",
      "\t* Healthy sleep habits\n",
      "5. **Supportive Care**: Offer supportive care and counseling to address mental health concerns, including depression, anxiety, or substance abuse.\n",
      "6. **Regular Monitoring**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and address any emerging issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to maintain a patient-centered approach, involving the patient in decision-making and providing ongoing support throughout their recovery process.\n"
